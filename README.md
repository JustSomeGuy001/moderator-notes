# Moderator Notes

Plugin for Oxwall software. Adds a widget to user profile page, where moderators can store notes visible only to other moderators.

Keeping track of user activies, especially when operating with a larger moderation team, can get very difficult. This plugin attempts to help alleviate some of the issues that arise, by allowing moderators to keep notes about individual users in the most obvious and convenient spot - right on that user's own profile. 

Entered notes are visible to all members of the moderation team, as well as all admins.

## Convenient Drop-down format, to avoid taking up space when it's not needed

## The list of existing notes is always visible, no need to expand the drop-down
